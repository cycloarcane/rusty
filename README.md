Welcome to my Rust learning repository! This is where I will be documenting my journey as I learn Rust programming language.

## About

This repository contains various Rust programs and exercises that I will be working on as I learn Rust. It serves as a personal log of my progress and a place to store my code for future reference.

## Getting Started

To get started with Rust, you'll need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Rust yet, you can do so by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Hello World

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Rust to get you started:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Rust says hi");
}
